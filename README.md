# Afterglow

A video and audio post-processing script for Plex (and other) HDTV DVR generated files using the ffmpeg-python binding library.


## Quick Start

If you're looking for something that is super simple, this [0.1a release of Afterglow](https://github.com/grobertson/afterglow/archive/first-alpha.zip) serves reasonably well. At the least, it's a better starting point for your own PPd script than many other options I surveyed. Reasonable familiarity with python is required.

If you're looking for good batch post-processing with some interesting features *NOW*, check out [Pytranscoder](https://github.com/mlsmithjr/transcoder). 

If you're looking for something that gracefully handles ridiculous volumes of encoding, can distribute its tasks across your available hardware, and can be managed from the cli or the web... Well, we'll see how long this Covid-19 thing lasts. 


## Features in 0.1a: 

- Very simple to use. No external configuration.

- Solid post-processing script for Plex's DVR (subscription required)

- Correctly detaches from stdin to prevent zombies when backgrounded.

- Includes simple batch processing script; re-encode a backlog of files! (see shell/ts-all)

- Needs testing


### Support and feature requests:

Nope. You're on your own. If there's a feature on your roadmap that ain't on mine, no worries. Fork and add it yourself! Its MIT licensed for a reason. Into sending PRs back? Please do! We love PRs. 

### Future:

I have plans to make Afterglow into something much more robust and "smart" over time. Who knows?

### Warranty

No fitness for any purpose, yadda yadda, expressed or implied, yadda yadda. If you shoot your eye out or delete all your files it's not my fault. Take only as directed. Should not be combined with other medications.

Side-effects may include reclaimed disk space and a higher average core temperature. 

Brief fits of delerium wherein the user believes themselves to be Peter Falk in one of the better "Columbo" made-for-TV movies have been reported in rare cases. Tell your doctor if you've seen a UFO -- It's not relevant to anything but, trust me, her reaction will be hilarious.
