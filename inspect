# When used in place of a Plex post processing script, this will dump a list of available codecs to /tmp/inspect.out and 
#   leave the recorded stream as-is.

# This can be useful if trying to work with the ffmpeg available by default within the post-processing environment.

# Note, this is NOT the ffmpeg and linked libraries you see when running /usr/bin/ffmpeg in most cases, 
#   even if you've asusmed the identity of the local plex user.

# To avoid this issue and use your locally installed ffmpeg, be sure to call the full path to ffmpeg during
#   post processing and wipe the shell environement when calling ffmpeg. 

ffmpeg -codecs 2>&1 >> /tmp/inspect.out
